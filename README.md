# Flappy_Bird

## Introduction

[*Flappy Bird*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird)  is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player says to ascend.

I have used two different approaches to play flappy bird. One with **Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)** and **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)**. I have implemented A2C from scratch and for NEAT I have used [neat-python](https://pypi.org/project/neat-python/) library.
